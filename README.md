I made gelgoog135's console script into a TamperMonkey script so that we don't need to copy and paste this snippet everytime.
I also added some part gelgoog135 missed.
## How to use
1. Install TamperMonkey
2. Visit the raw file link of `Moodle quiz revisor.user.js`, it should prompt for installation. If it didn't then, copy the content.
3. (Alternate) Add a new script in TamperMonkey and paste the content
4. Visit a quiz and see the magic.
